#Smart Shopper
My personal contribution to the TreeHacks 2023 competition.

Features an expandable chatbox UI within which the user may talk with a trained OpenAI JS React program.

IMPORTANT:

In this demo, no AI chat is visible as I did not work on that part.
I was responsible for the front-end display. As such, the program will simply repeat user input.
You may view our final project demonstrated in the PowerPoint linked below; some UI changes have been made in this version.
